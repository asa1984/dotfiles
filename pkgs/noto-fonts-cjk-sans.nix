        Noto ${typeface} CJK is a ${lib.toLower typeface} typeface designed as
        an intermediate style between the modern and traditional. It is
        intended to be a multi-purpose digital font for user interface
        designs, digital content, reading on laptops, mobile devices, and
        electronic books. Noto ${typeface} CJK comprehensively covers
        Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese, Japanese, and Korean in a
        unified font family. It supports regional variants of ideographic
        characters for each of the four languages. In addition, it supports
        Japanese kana, vertical forms, and variant characters (itaiji); it
        supports Korean hangeul â€” both contemporary and archaic.
