        When text is rendered by a computer, sometimes characters are
        displayed as “tofu”. They are little boxes to indicate your device
        doesn’t have a font to display the text.

        Google has been developing a font family called Noto, which aims to
        support all languages with a harmonious look and feel. Noto is
        Google’s answer to tofu. The name noto is to convey the idea that
        Google’s goal is to see “no more tofu”.  Noto has multiple styles and
        weights, and freely available to all.

        This package also includes the Arimo, Cousine, and Tinos fonts.
